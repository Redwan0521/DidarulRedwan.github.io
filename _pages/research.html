<h2> A. PrimateFace: Large-Scale Dataset for Advancing Primate Face Analysis </h2>
<img src="/primateface_fig1.png" alt="PrimateFace Figure 1" width="500">
<p>Created the largest cross-species dataset of primate faces, PrimateFace, containing over 500,000 annotated images spanning 100+ primate species, and developed state-of-the-art deep learning models for primate face detection, facial landmark tracking, face recognition, and facial action unit recognition that generalize across diverse morphologies and settings. This work pioneers efficient computer vision techniques to enhance understanding of primate facial expressions, social communication, and behavior.</p>

<h2> B. Decoding physician visual attention during neonatal resuscitation </h2>
<img src="/neogaze_fig1.png" alt="Neogaze Figure 1" width="500">
<p>Developed a real-time deep learning system to classify physician visual attention targets during live neonatal resuscitations. Integrated commercial eye-tracking glasses with computer vision techniques to decode gaze patterns directly from first-person video. Built novel egocentric dataset and training pipelines leveraging vision transformers like CLIP and MobileViT. System operates in real-time and achieves over 98% gaze classification accuracy, enabling objective quantification of physician attention dynamics. Project aims to uncover inefficiencies in high-acuity scenarios to optimize training protocols and team coordination, thereby improving patient outcomes.</p>
