My name is Felipe and I'm a PhD Candidate in the [Computational Neuroscience Initiative](https://cni.upenn.edu/) at Penn. I am co-supervised by [Konrad Kording](http://kordinglab.com/) and [Michael Platt](http://plattlabs.rocks/), under whom I study the neural processes underlying primate social grooming. I am interested in how primates _naturally_ behave and interact with the environment. To do this, I pool techniques from neuroengineering (e.g., wireless brain-computer interfaces), computer vision (e.g., pose estimation), and ethology (e.g., focal sampling).

<!-- I am originally from Buenos Aires, Argentina, but I completed most of my education in Miami, FL. For undergrad, I studied Neuroscience and Economics at the University of Miami (go Canes!). At UM, I hopped from lab to lab, and eventually found my way towards Dr. Elizabeth Losin's Social & Cultural Neuroscience Lab, where I helped collect data for work on neurolinguistic pain modulation in Spanish-English bilinguals. Following graduation, I worked as a Psychometrician for First Choice Neurology under Dr. Rafael Rivas-Vazquez, where I developed and administered psychometric assessments to individuals with neuropsychological disorders.  -->
